# CineMatch

CineMatch is a browser-based photo color-matching tool. Choose a photo to edit and a reference photo, compare the before-and-after preview, refine the suggested Lightroom-style settings, and export the result.

The app runs locally in your browser. Your photos are processed on your device and are not sent to an inference API.

## Features

- Upload a source photo and a reference image (JPEG, PNG, WebP, or supported camera RAW formats such as ARW, CR2, CR3, NEF, and DNG).
- Compare the original and matched result with a draggable split preview.
- Inspect luminance histograms and dominant colors.
- Adjust white balance, tone, tone curve, HSL, color grading, and match strength.
- Optionally protect likely skin-colored pixels from aggressive HSL and grading color shifts.
- Apply manual radial barrel/pincushion distortion correction.
- Export the matched image as PNG or copy Lightroom-compatible preset XML and settings.
- Optionally run a locally trained ONNX model in the browser.
- Fall back to the built-in calculation-based matcher when no trained model is installed.

RAW files are developed locally by LibRaw into an RGB image that can be edited and exported as PNG. This does not modify or export the original sensor data. The manual distortion control is not camera/lens-profile based; automatic lens profiles and Lightroom-grade RAW rendering are not implemented. Optical correction is baked into PNG exports, not copied into XMP presets.

## Run locally

Requirements: Node.js and npm.

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the local address printed by Vite. The development server sets the cross-origin isolation headers required by the RAW decoder. Static deployments need to set `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` and `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` too.

To create a single-HTML app build:

```powershell
npm run build
```

The app page is written to `dist/Grade Match.html`; LibRaw's worker bundles are separate files in `dist/`, so keep the complete output directory together and serve it with the headers above to use RAW decoding. Use the development server when testing a local ONNX model.

## AI model and current status

The optional AI is a supervised neural network trained locally with Python and exported to ONNX. The browser runs ONNX inference using ONNX Runtime Web. The model accepts summaries of the source and reference images and predicts 50 Lightroom-style adjustment values.

The model is trained locally to imitate the JavaScript color-matching solver on synthetic same-photo pairs. The browser runs both the ONNX model and the calculation matcher, then selects the result with the lower measured distance to the reference. This is a quality guard, not a claim that the neural network is more accurate than its teacher. Portrait expansion and the skin-protection limitation are documented in [the training guide](docs/ai-training.md#portrait-focused-expansion-and-skin-tone-handling).

The latest run used 1,096 solver-labeled pairs: 1,000 flower, 60 diverse-scene, and 36 additional portrait pairs (876 training / 220 held-out groups). It stopped after 188 epochs and restored the best checkpoint from epoch 148. Validation MSE was 0.12175 and normalized MAE was 0.21357, compared with a 0.32989 zero-output baseline (35.3% lower MAE). These are setting-prediction metrics on synthetic solver labels, not perceptual accuracy or skin-tone precision. The ONNX model and detailed run statistics are Git-ignored under `public\models\` and `dataset\`; they are not included in a fresh clone. See [the training curve](docs/training_curves.svg) and [the training guide](docs/ai-training.md#training-report-and-graph).

### Train a compact local model

Requirements: Python 3.12 or newer. From PowerShell in the project folder:

```powershell
py -3 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r requirements-train.txt
python prepare_synthetic_training.py
python train_color_matcher.py --manifest dataset\flower_match\train.jsonl --output public\models\color_matcher.onnx
```

The preparation script downloads TensorFlow's 218 MB Flower Photos archive and generates three synthetic edits of each of 3,670 flower photos. Training and validation use separate source photos. The labels are synthetic, not expert retouching or proof of general photo-style matching. The photos are CC BY 2.0; keep the generated attribution file with the local dataset and review the license before redistribution. The dataset and trained model are ignored by Git.

For your own dataset, each JSONL training example needs a source image, a reference image, and the desired adjustment settings. See the training guide for the full schema and instructions.

## How matching works

1. The app extracts color and tone statistics from the source and reference images.
2. If a local ONNX model is available, it predicts adjustment settings from the two image summaries.
3. Otherwise, the built-in calculation-based matcher estimates settings from the image statistics.
4. The selected adjustments are applied to a browser canvas for preview and image export.

The model does not generate pixels directly. It predicts adjustment controls; the app applies those controls to the source image.
